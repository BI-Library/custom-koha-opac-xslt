Custom XSLT files for the results and detail views in Koha

These files represent edits to the default XSLT files in the Koha OPAC so that only the a and b subfields of $245, without ISBD or other erroneous punctuation (e.g. trailing slashes and periods), are should in the results and detail views.

Please note: when changing Koha XSLT files, it is advised to use duplicates of the originals rather than editing the originals directly.
